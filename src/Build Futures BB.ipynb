    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This notebook needs an active Bloomberg connection to run. This task was discussed with professor and done in the Financial Mathematics computer lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data output is a mulit-index dataframe with index levels - Commodity, Contract number, Date\n",
    "\n",
    "Covers all the data as per availability for each commodity from 1st to expire upto 12th to expire. Some commodity codes were adjusted for BBG versus the paper (for example: Aluminum has Bloomberg symbol as \"LA\" versue \"AL\" in the paper). \n",
    "\n",
    "Total commodities - 31\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commodities which have only 1st to expire contracts and no other contract data available - Barley, Coal, Propane, Broilers\n",
    "- Commodity which has data starting after Dec 2008 - Butter\n",
    "- For most commodities we are able to fetch data upto 12th to expire contract, however some commodities do not have data so further out. For all the details, see the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloomberg\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data download from BBG API is inconsistent and sporadic depending on the size of the data pull. The notebook has been setup in such a way, to try redownloading if a ticker missed out on downloading data.\n",
    "\n",
    "FinMath Library (pandas version)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas version in FinMath library was outdated/old (1.5.3). This meant that the pickle files (original datastructure) saved from this version could not be read in our personal laptops (pandas version 2+). This was resolved by saving the files in .csv format instead which could be used independent of the Pandas version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on commodity futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Each commodity future contract starts trading approximately 2-2.5 years before its scheduled expiry. So at any point in time, each commodity can have upto 20 live contracts being traded on the exchange. These contracts usually roll on a monthly basis, depening on the contract specifications (see Bloomberg <DES> for more details).    \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the liquidity is only really significant before 6-12 months (something the paper also accounts for). Bloomberg already accounts for the rolling of contracts and constructs a time series for each commodity with respect to the expiry. For example, this can be checked as 'NG1 Comdty' for 1st to expire Natural Gas contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For backtest and research purpose, we use these time series downloaded from Bloomberg for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on roll adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "The price-adjustment for rolling of the contracts has been done. We apply ratio-adjusted methodology."
